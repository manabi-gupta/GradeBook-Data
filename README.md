# GradeBook-Data
This is my another project where I have tried to analyse.
This project analyzes employee performance across multiple training assessments and compliance tests.
It uses Excel formulas, conditional formatting, and data visualization to identify underperforming employees and automate HR decisions.

## Overview

Each employee is evaluated on:

Safety Test (10 points)
-Company Philosophy Test (20 points)
-Financial Skill Test (100 points)
-Drug Test (1 = Pass / 0 = Fail)
-The dataset includes calculated percent scores, maximum/minimum values, and average performance across all tests.

## Features

-Automated grading system using Excel formulas for percentage calculation.
-Traffic light indicators (green, yellow, red) showing each employee’s score visually.
-Dynamic average, max, and min calculations for quick performance insights.
-Conditional formatting highlights failing scores and test issues instantly.
-“Fire Employee” logic that automatically flags employees who failed critical criteria (e.g., 0 in Drug Test or <50% in any test).
